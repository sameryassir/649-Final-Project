        <!-- Narrative Section -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Abortion rights and reproductive healthcare access have become some of the most contentious issues in the United States. Recent years have seen shifts in abortion policy, leaving millions of women with vastly different access to care depending on where they live. The overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court in 2022 fundamentally changed the legal landscape, giving individual states the power to regulate abortion. This decision, and further political developments, have created disparities in access to abortion services, with implications for women’s health.

        <h2>Timeline of Abortion Services</h2>
        <p>
            The story of abortion policy is not static; it continues to evolve. The November 13, 2024, elections marked another pivotal moment. Several states held referenda or passed legislation altering their abortion policies. For example, one state shifted from a 15-week ban to a total ban, while another reinstated protections up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.

        <h2>Abortion Policies Across U.S. States</h2>
        <p>
            To understand these changes, our interactive U.S. map highlights the current abortion policies in each state. Clicking on a state reveals its specific restrictions, ranging from gestational limits like 6-week or 12-week bans to total prohibitions. Our visualization allows users to explore these recent changes, offering a dynamic view of how political decisions impact access to reproductive healthcare in real-time.

        <h2>Impacts on Maternal Health</h2>
        <p>
            These restrictive abortion policies don’t just limit access; they come with serious consequences for women’s health. In states with total bans, maternal mortality rates have risen. Data shows that women in these states are more likely to experience complications from unsafe or delayed procedures. For marginalized communities, including low-income women and women of color, the risks are even greater. Our analysis links the restrictive policies to measurable increases in maternal deaths and severe health outcomes. These trends are driven by several factors: lack of access to safe abortion services, delayed medical intervention during pregnancy complications, and reduced availability of healthcare providers in areas with bans. The data paints a sobering picture: policies intended to restrict abortion often result in worse health outcomes overall.
