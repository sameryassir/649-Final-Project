        <p>
            Abortion rights and reproductive healthcare access have become some of the most contentious issues in the United States. Recent years have seen shifts in abortion policy, leaving millions of women with vastly different access to care depending on where they live. The overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court in 2022 fundamentally changed the legal landscape, giving individual states the power to regulate abortion. This decision, and further political developments, has created disparities in access to abortion services, with implications for women’s health.        
        </p>
        <p>
            For nearly 50 years, Roe v. Wade which was passed on January 22, 1973 guaranteed the constitutional right to abortion, setting the groundwork for reproductive health policy across the nation. Its repeal on June 24, 2022, marked by the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, abruptly ended federal protections and handed the issue over to states. As of today, the result in the United States has diverse and conflicting abortion policies. States like Texas, Alabama, and Arkansas have implemented total abortion bans, while others, such as California and Illinois, continue to provide broad access. The changes brought about by Dobbs have had immediate and measurable effects.    
        </p>

        <!-- First Visualization -->
        <h3>Timeline of Abortion Services</h3>
        <p>
            Following the repeal of Roe v. Wade, abortion policies across the United States have drastically diverged, leading to significant variations in access. The plot below provides a detailed visualization of clinician-provided abortions across states over time, starting in 2023 illustrating how state-specific policies have influenced the number of procedures performed. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            This visualization not only highlights the trends in states with restrictive laws but also shows the access in states that maintain non-restrictive policies. By allowing users to explore these data points, the plot aims to provide an interactive and comprehensive understanding of the real-world impacts of these legal and policy changes on reproductive health services. Each state can be selected to showcase the number of clinician-provided abortions. However, there is no data in some states or a sudden stop of abortions due to bans.

            User Guide: Select a state using the drop down menu to view the number of clinician-provided abortions over time. The plot shows the number of abortions performed in each state, with confidence intervals to indicate the uncertainty in the data. The data is based on the most recent available information, providing a snapshot of the current landscape of abortion services in the United States.

        <h3>Abortion Policies Map</h3>
        <p>
            Further, the story of abortion policy is not static; it continues to evolve. 
            The November 13, 2024, elections marked another pivotal moment. 
            Several states held referenda or passed legislation altering their abortion policies.
            For example, one state shifted from a 15-week ban to a total ban, while another reinstated protections up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand these changes, our interactive U.S. map highlights the current abortion policies in each state. Clicking on a state reveals its specific restrictions, ranging from gestational limits like 6-week or 12-week bans to total prohibitions. Our visualization allows users to explore these recent changes, offering a dynamic view of how political decisions impact access to reproductive healthcare in real-time.

            User Guide: Hold shift key to select multiple abortion policies. Hover over a state to view its specific abortion restrictions. The map provides a visual representation of the current abortion policies across the United States, allowing users to explore the diversity of laws and regulations that shape access to reproductive healthcare.

        <h3>Impacts on Maternal Health</h3>
        <p>
            These restrictive abortion policies don’t just limit access, they come with serious consequences for women’s health. In states with total bans, maternal mortality rates have risen. Data shows that women in these states are more likely to experience complications from unsafe or delayed procedures. For marginalized communities, including low-income women and women of color, the risks are even greater. Our analysis links the restrictive policies to measurable increases in maternal deaths and severe health outcomes. These trends are driven by several factors: lack of access to safe abortion services, delayed medical intervention during pregnancy complications, and reduced availability of healthcare providers in areas with bans. The data paints a sobering picture: policies intended to restrict abortion often result in worse health outcomes for women overall.

            User Guide: Hover over a state to view its maternal mortality rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The map visualization above provides a state-by-state representation of maternal mortality rates, showcasing disparities in maternal health outcomes across the United States. The darker shades correspond to higher mortality rates, revealing trends in states with restrictive abortion policies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The United States abortion policies to the timeline of abortion services, the data underscores the consequences of the system. Women in states with restrictive policies face barriers not only to abortion but also to broader reproductive healthcare, which further intensifies health inequities. This can be broken down further by Age and Race. 
        </p>
        <iframe src="lineplot.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
            User Guide: Zoom in and out of the plot and hover over data points to view the data by age and/or race. The plot provides a visual representation of the disparities in abortion services across different age groups and racial demographics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The visualizations above dive deeper into the nuances of maternal mortality by examining trends across age groups and racial subgroups. The first chart displays maternal mortality rates by age, highlighting the significant risk increase among women aged 40 and older. This age group consistently experiences the highest mortality rates, with a sharp peak observed in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second chart focuses on racial disparities in maternal mortality, revealing that Black, non-Hispanic women face the highest rates, followed by American Indian or Alaska Native women. These trends may reflect systemic healthcare inequities and the disproportionate impact of restrictive abortion policies on marginalized communities. Together, these visualizations show the intersectionality of age, race, and healthcare access, emphasizing the urgent need for equitable maternal health policies that address these disparities.   
        </p>
        <p>
            As the legal landscape continues to shift, it is crucial to understand the real-world impacts of these policies. The decisions made impact the lives of millions of women, affecting their health, autonomy, and well-being. This project doesn’t seek to take a political stance but instead aims to inform, educate, and foster a deeper understanding of the data behind the debate.        </p>
        <p>
            Through interactive visualizations and data-driven storytelling, we invite readers to explore the evolving story of abortion rights in the United States. By presenting evidence to the discussion, we hope to provide clarity on an issue that affects so many lives. The question remains: how can we create a system that ensures equitable healthcare for all women, regardless of where they live?
